<h1 class='info'> 2020! What a bright year! </h1>

<h3> It's been basically April already and I just realized, I never had a new year's resolution.
  Because for me, the year never changed. I never put in the time, to think my 2019 and plan or dream for 2020.
   But now, the time is finally here. Now is the time where I reflect and dream.
</h3>

<p>
How was my 2019? I am not sure. To be honest it was really crazy, and I remember half of the things that actually happened.
 Last year, I got to know Alexia and find my girlfriend, who I love. Last year I got grow more than any other year. I had to put my self aside
 and protect others. I had to forgive and be considerate. I had to mature and become an adult. I had to experiment and find myself.
  I had to try new things. I had to be adventurous and courageous. I had to meet new people, travel the world, and be bold. I changed continent... to be continued. .
I got to explore situations people would call me crazy for. I got to open up about myself, become vulnerable in front of others and that made me stronger.
