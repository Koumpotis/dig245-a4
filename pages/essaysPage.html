<h2 class='info'> My purpose </h2>
<p class='passage'> This essay explores my thoughts on someone's purpose. It was inspired by Kierkegaard's <em>Fear and Τrembling. </em></p>
<h1 class='essayTitle'>My purpose, as evoked by Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling</h1>

<p class='text'>
  One of the ideas discussed in class during our discussion of Kierkegaard’s Fear and
Tremble was purpose. I was thinking that everyone suggests that they have a purpose and that I
should find my purpose as well until I took a step back and questioned why do I need to have a
purpose? We often ask ourselves what is our purpose, but we never ask why do we need a
purpose or even why do we think we have a purpose? Why do I need to have a purpose, why do I
need to serve something specific, other than myself? Why can’t I just live my life, and make
decisions as they arise, without having a fixed factor created and imposed by society, that
influences my decisions? After deep thinking, it seems to me that the answer to the question is
out of arrogance and insecurity.<br>
</p><p class='text'>
Out of arrogance, because we think we are worthy enough to advocate for a single cause,
because we want to give ourselves a greater meaning than just being ourselves. I find this
mentality very pessimistic because it implies that, me, being and serving myself is not enough
for the world, but most importantly for myself, to appreciate. It implies that I need to serve
something, supposedly, greater than me, like religion, or justice. I disagree, however, as I believe
serving my self and my own happiness is more than enough; and that is because I refuse to serve
other people when that means neglecting myself, and when I serve religion, for example, I am
neglecting myself, as I am giving my unique ability to decide for my actions and my worth to
something other than myself. Doing things for me is enough. And someone telling me it’s not,
shouldn’t make me change my mind, nor neglect myself. Society has taught us that we are
insignificant, that we don’t matter, that these other things are greater than us. That is just a way
to limit individuals and hold power. Society has made us believe that we are inside a box with
concrete walls, for our own benefit, suggesting that we are free to do whatever we want but to
never try to escape these walls because then we are bad, evil or a threat. But the only way to be
truly free is to realize, that these walls do not exist; and even if they exist they are not concrete,
they are infinitely elastic, with unlimited possibility and unlimited limits. To have a purpose out
of arrogance, out of the need to associate oneself with something greater, is like wanting to eat
microwaved pasta while holding in your own hands the most delicious bowl of pasta ever made
by the most skilled chef of all time. Why would anyone want to eat microwaved pasta, when
they already hold the greatest pasta of all time? Why would I want to serve something great
when I am the greatest thing ever created? Why would you want to serve something great when
you are the greatest thing ever created? Why you and I are the greatest thing ever created?
Because we have no limits, because our potential is infinite, and we can feel and think more than
anything else can or ever will. Because we are the infinitude in a body of finitude!

Then needing a purpose can manifest itself out insecurity. Insecurity, for ones’
capabilities and decision making. I can see why having a purpose numbs this insecurity but that’s
all it does. It numbs it, it doesn’t help the individual fight it, it doesn’t permanently eradicates it,
it just numbs it temporarily. Having a purpose acts as an excuse, that facilitates decision making,
but when it comes out of insecurity, the same way with arrogance, it results to neglecting myself,
because I stop making decisions for myself, considering myself, and I start making decisions, for
myself, considering the ‘greater’ causes’ needs. That neglect results in myself being bound by
societal rules, to always stay within them. But I don’t want to be the society, I want to be me, I
want to break those boundaries, set my own rules for myself and reach my unlimited potential. I
want to constantly evolve myself, through my decision making. The very same decision making
that makes me feel insecure is the key for me to grow, is the only way for me to come as close as
possible to my potential. We have convinced ourselves that we need to have a purpose, and
somewhere along the way, we forgot we need to have ourselves. I refuse all purposes serving
something greater than me, simply because there’s nothing greater than myself. There is nothing
greater than an individual’s unlimited potential. There is nothing greater than the individual. I am
the world. The world is me. That’s the only thing I know, and the only thing I am willing and
able to advocate for. I will always help others, always offer my services, but I will never serve
someone else. Helping and being there for others is a necessity, it is needed for my soul to be at
peace, but serving others is poison stronger than Polonium, as it kills the heart and mind, instead
of the body. It kills my self. <br> <br>

<p class='text'>
So the reason I need a purpose is insignificant. The nature of the purpose, however, is of
utmost importance. If the purpose is serving myself, then I am on the path to becoming divine. If
the purpose is serving society, I am on the path to destruction. My purpose should be serving
myself, and benefiting society, but it shouldn’t serve society and benefiting myself. Because in
the case of serving the society, the benefit I am harvesting is not honest benefit. It is misery and
pain disguised as a benefit. Serving myself, however, offers a sincere, a humane benefit to
society and that is the only way for society to prosper and myself to reach divinity
