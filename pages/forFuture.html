<h1> Things to do and/or know for the future</h1>
<p> 1. Live in Cuba or Brazil. <br>
  Live in a small apartment with a window but a nice view, kind neighbors.
  Have a light blue Vespa. Wear white tees and just live a happy care free life.
Wake up every morning next to the person you love, kiss them and start your beautiful day. <br>
</p>
<p> 2. Live in a lonely cabin deep on the mountain with your loved ones. <br>
Spend the winter in a cold mountain. Light a fire and enjoy your drink. Have a cat and a dog, as well as your guitar. Do not forget your guitar!
Have a bunch of wines stocked and plenty of food.  </p>
