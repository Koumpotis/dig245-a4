    <em>This Blog aims at expressing and putting together my philosophical thoughts,
      that way I can organize my thoughts better and reach better conclusions.
      Maybe people will want to contribute their piece of mind and we can discuss and explore.

    Passage from my essay "My purpose": <br>
              I want to constantly evolve myself, through my decision making.
              The very same decision making that makes me feel insecure is the
              key for me to grow, is the only way for me to come as close as
              possible to my potential. We have convinced ourselves that we
              need to have a purpose, and somewhere along the way, we forgot
              we need to have ourselves.

    The reason I am drawn to philosophy is because it seeks the truth, without imposing the definition you
    conclude to. Philosophy is the adult version of a playground.

                "Søren Aabye Kierkegaard was a profound and prolific writer
                in the Danish “golden age” of intellectual and artistic activity.
                 His work crosses the boundaries of philosophy, theology,
                 psychology, literary criticism, devotional literature and
                 fiction." </em> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/">Read more here!</a>

                 I discovered philosophy through my class, <em>PHI210: Existentialism.</em>
                I mean that is the first time I studied and read philosophy. But I' ve been thinking about philosophy
                and philosophically for the past 5-6 years. If I needed to confess something to
                you right now, I would confess that I always felt a bit different and left-out
                because of the way philosophy has made me understand things. Anyway.

                  I am freshman at Davidson college, born and raised in Thessaloniki, Greece.
                  I've had the pleasure to work with diverse and multicultural
                  teams in Davidson, San Francisco, Paris, Dublin, and Greece and that has allowed me to
                  experience and observe different cultural habits and traits. Being aware of the ways of
                  other people has made me more flexible, open minded and excited.
