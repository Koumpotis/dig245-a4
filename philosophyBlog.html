      I am freshman at Davidson college, born and raised in Greece.</h1>

      <p class = 'info'>I discovered philosophy through my class, <em>PHI210: Existentialism.</em>
        I mean that is the first time I studied and read philosophy. But I' ve been thinking about philosophy
        and philosophically for the past 5-6 years. If I needed to confess something to
        you right now, I would confess that I always felt a bit different and left-out
        because of the way philosophy has made me understand things. Anyway.

        <h3 class='passage'> <em>This Blog aims at expressing and putting together my philosophical thoughts,
          that way I can organize my thoughts better and reach better conclusions.
          Maybe people will want to contribute their piece of mind and we can discuss and explore.

                "Søren Aabye Kierkegaard was a profound and prolific writer
                in the Danish “golden age” of intellectual and artistic activity.
                 His work crosses the boundaries of philosophy, theology,
                 psychology, literary criticism, devotional literature and
                 fiction." </em> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/">Read more here!</a>

              <p class='passage'> Passage from my essay "My purpose": <br>
                I want to constantly evolve myself, through my decision making.
                The very same decision making that makes me feel insecure is the
                 key for me to grow, is the only way for me to come as close as
                  possible to my potential. We have convinced ourselves that we
                   need to have a purpose, and somewhere along the way, we forgot
                   we need to have ourselves.  </p>
